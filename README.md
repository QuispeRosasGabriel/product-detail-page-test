# About this project

This project is created with React + TS + Material UI. Also, we're using little bit of screaming architecture where we group items by business logic like ProductDetailsPage and put the components inside. This is helpful cause you can identify better where the components are.

Todo:

- Implement some Unit Tests
- Complete landing page
- All is implemented by "modules" so an improvement could be to extract the module of components in a custom library inside the project, maybe using NX and reuse in the rest of the app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
